# languist

Languist is a framework for analysis of both the static and the run-time properties of programs written in a growing list of supported dynamically typed programming languages. It also supports refactoring/rewriting and helps for generating idiomatic high level code.

It also defines an intermediate `interlang` API which supports multi-language idioms/API-s.

It can be used as a basis for creating:

* source-to-source translation tools such as `rb2nim` and `py2nim`
* source code indexing and cross-referencing engines
* automated refactoring tools
* automated debugging tools
* efficient language servers (edited)
